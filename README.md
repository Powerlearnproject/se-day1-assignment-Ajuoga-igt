Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering involves the application of engineering principles in the development and maintenance of software. In the technological industry software engineering enables the development and creation of software applications and systems that drive different aspects of life such as communication and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fotran and C 
Establishment of Software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Involves gathering user needs and system requirements
Design-Creation of high level and detailed software architecture and user interface 
Implementation- Writing of code and building software based on specifications 
Testing- Checking whether software meets quality standard and functionality
Deployment- Releasing the software to users
Maintenance- Providing enhancements, ongoing support and updates to the software following deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is sequencial and involves a sequencial approach with distinct phases such as requirements,design and implementation whereas the Agile methodology has an incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collabration and focuses on responding to change.
Waterfall methodology is applicable in scenarios where the has clearly defined requirements with low flexibility to change whereby Agile methodology is applicable in projects that are flexible with constant requirement changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Writing Code and and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Oversees planning, execution and development of software system.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
These tools enhance productivity, collaboration and ensure code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control debugging tools and automated testing capabilities.
IDEs include Visual Studio and Eclipse whereas VCS include GIt and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines- This can be overcome through prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
Changing Requirements-: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Researching on ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.
Limited Infrastructure- Software engineers must rely heavily on a strong and reliable infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Rapid technological advancement- Adapting to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing -Involves testing out individual components or software modules.
System Testing-Involves testing of the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance -Testing of user requirements and ensuring they meet user needs. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of guiding generative AI solutions in order to give desired output.
The importance of interacting with AI models:
It provides improved user experience by enabling users obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
Increased Flexibility as a prompt engineer can create prompts with domain neutral instructions and broad patterns.
Developer Control is enhanced as it gives developers more control over interactions of the User and AI. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Generate an image of a baby
Clear- Generate an image of a baby in a black stroller. 
Specific - A baby with brown eyes and fair complexion and dark hair on a sunny day licking a pospicle beneath the trees.
Concise-A baby smiling while licking a popsicle in the park beneath a tree shade in the park.
